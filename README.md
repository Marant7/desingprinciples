# Software Design Principles in Python

This project demonstrates the application of common software design principles like SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, and DIP using Python code.

### Structure
- `order.py`: Defines the `Order` class to handle order details.
- `payment_methods.py`: Contains the classes for different payment methods.
- `order_service.py`: Implements the `OrderService` class to process orders.

### Run the code

You can test the code by running:

```bash
python order_service.py
